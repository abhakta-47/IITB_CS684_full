(* 
Everytime a occurs, c will remain continuously true from then on until a b occurs 
Design decisions:
- b is given higher priority ie. if b occurs c will be false
- so if a and b occurs together c will become false

node smonitor(a:bool; b:bool) returns (c: bool)
let
    c = if b then false else a or (a->pre c);
